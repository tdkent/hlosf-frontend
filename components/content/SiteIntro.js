        For San Francisco 1976 is a twin bicentennial, the anniversary of the founding of both the Nation and the City. It seems therefore particularly
        appropriate for residents and visitors alike to become more aware of the City&apos;s past. One way of reaching this goal is by visiting the 38
        California State Registered Historical Landmarks to be found within San Francisco.

        Anyone who has traveled in California has seen the handsome bronze plaques which designate State Historical Landmarks. These tablets are placed at sites
        of <q>statewide historical significance</q> which have{' '}
        <q>anthropological, cultural, military, political, architectural, economic, scientific or technical, religious, experimental, or other values</q>,
        according to the State Department of Parks and Recreation handbook California Historical Landmarks. A seven member advisory committee appointed by the
        Governor determines whether a given site is worthy of landmark status or not. There are well over 800 such landmarks throughout the state, with new ones
        being added each year. Not all sites have official state plaques. Some have tablets provided by private organizations, e.g. the Native Sons of Daughters
        of the Golden West, the California Historical Society, the Society of California Pioneers, the Daughters of the American Revolution, etc., while other
        sites remain unmarked.
