            Much of the content on this site was created in 1976, and the text herein often refers to that year. This material was intended to be published at
            that time; it never was. But through the magic of the internet, it has been resurrected in the form you see.

            The great thing about most historic sites, and the plaques that commemorate them, is that they donâ€™t change much, if at all, through time. Telegraph
            Hill is still Telegraph Hill, and Union Square is still Union Square. So the stuff I wrote in that remote, antediluvian time is still for the most
            part valid today. I have, nonetheless, carefully reviewed the text and made changes and updates where appropriate.{' '}
